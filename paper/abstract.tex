\begin{abstract}
    We present an algorithm for Multi-Modal Symmetric Diffeomorphic Image Registration. The transfer functions between the two modalities are modeled as a set of
    hidden variables, which results in a metric that may be regarded as a generalization of the Correlation Ratio. We apply the greedy symmetric image normalization method
    (SyN) to efficiently maximize the image similarity metric in the space of diffeomorphic transformations. We validate our algorithm using the publicly available IBSR database
    and the Brainweb synthetic template, obtaining very competitive results in both mono- and multi-modal image registration. As a natural extension, we generalize the widely used
    normalized Cross Correlation (CC) metric, for multi-modality images, and show that the resulting metric, Expected Cross Correlation (ECC),
    performs better than the original Cross Correlation in the multi-modal case, without compromising performance in the mono-modal case.
