    We present an algorithm for Multi-Modal Symmetric Diffeomorphic Image Registration. The transfer functions between the two modalities are modeled as a set of
    hidden variables whose values are estimated using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. We apply the symmetric image normalization method (SyN) to
    maximize the image similarity defined by the transfer functions estimated in the E-step. We validate our algorithm using the publicly available IBSR database
    and the Brainweb synthetic template, obtaining very competitive results in both mono- and multi-modal image registration. Besides its simplicity, the EM
    Metric presents promising properties that can be exploited to design more sophisticated metrics. As a simple example, we extend the widely used Cross
    Correlation (CC) metric, which may not be used for multi-modality images in general. We show that our extension, Expected Cross Correlation (ECC),
    performs better than Cross Correlation in the multi-modal case, while being very competitive even in the mono-modal case.
