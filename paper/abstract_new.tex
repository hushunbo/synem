    We present a new matching functional for multi-modal brain MRI registration. The relationship between both image modalities is modeled as a global non-linear function that makes to local relationship between intensities of corresponding voxels as linear as possible. The proposed matching functional results from a maximum-likelihood estimation of our model's parameters. We show that our functional is closely related to the optimum transfer function used in the Correlation Ratio functional and the Squared Normalized Local Cross Correlation metric (whose robustness for mono-modal brain MRI registration has been demonstrated in recent comparative studies). We implemented our matching functional to drive the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) transformation model and compared its performance to traditional matching functionals using real, publicly available, brain MRI images. Quantitative results show that our matching functional performs better than cross correlation and mutual information in the multi-modal case without reducing performance in the mono-modal case.
