    We present a new matching functional for multi-modal brain MRI registration. The relationship between voxel intensities in both modalities is modeled as a global non-linear function that makes their local relationship as linear as possible. The proposed matching functional results from a maximum-likelihood estimation of our model's parameters. We show that our functional is closely related to the local Cross Correlation functional (whose robustness for mono-modal brain MRI registration has been demonstrated in recent comparative studies) and the optimal transfer function used in the Correlation Ratio. We implemented our matching functional to drive the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) transformation model and compared its performance to traditional matching functionals using real, publicly available, brain MR images. Quantitative results show that our matching functional performs better than cross correlation and mutual information in the multi-modal case without reducing performance in the mono-modal case.
