\section{Experiments}
One of the most challenging aspects of developing image registration algorithms for brain MRI is validation. In order to rigorously evaluate the performance of non-linear
image registration algorithms, a ground-truth consisting of true correspondences between voxels of realistic pairs of images would be required. Since such a ground-truth data is
not currently available, researchers resort to surrogates that indirectly measure the quality of their algorithms. One of the most accepted surrogate measures is based
on the overlap of localized anatomical areas of registered images: ideally, corresponding anatomical areas of perfectly registered images should perfectly
overlap. Even a perfect registration algorithm is unlikely to achieve such an ambitious goal, though, since anatomical areas are usually defined manually by an expert, which is
by no means a perfect process and the annotations may vary even between different experts. Despite this limitation, it has been shown that among the alternative surrogate measures
usually employed, overlap scores of localized anatomical areas is the one that better distinguish reasonable from inaccurate registrations \cite{Rohlfing2012} and it has been employed
in the most rigorous evaluations of registration algorithms \cite{Klein2009}\cite{Klein2010}\cite{Rohlfing2012}. We also believe that rigorous reproducibility is of utmost importance. In our
experiments, we employ the publicly available IBSR database consisting of 18 manually annotated T1 brain MRI volumes, and our algorithms are publicly available from the Dipy
non-linear registration module \cite{Garyfallidis2014}.

\subsection{Mono-modal registration}
Although our algorithms were designed for multi-modal image registration, it is important to first verify that the quality of the algorithms is reasonable for mono-modal registration.
Table \ref{tab:monomodal_results_seg} and figure \ref{fig:mono_graph_seg} show the average overlap score for each of 31 manually annotated anatomical regions from the IBSR database.
Note that the Jaccard indices obtained with the Cross Correlation metric (i.e. ANTS) are higher than reported by Rohlfing {\it et al.} \cite{Rohlfing2012}. In his experiments, he used
three resolutions with a maximum of 10, 10 and 5 iterations only. Here, we set a maximum of 100, 100 and 25 iterations, leaving the rest of the parameters
unchanged. We can see that SyN with the EM metric is very competitive, but still not as good as Cross Correlation. This may be explained by the fact that CC uses a relatively large
window centered at each voxel for computing the similarity, while the EM is voxelwise. This behavior can also be observed from the results of SyN with Mutual Information (MI), which is also
voxelwise and very competitve but not as good as CC. By considering neighborhoods of the same size, the Expected Cross Correlation metric performs
nearly as good as CC. Table \ref{tab:monomodal_results_segTri_fill} and figure \ref{fig:mono_graph_segTri_fill} show the overlap scores over tissue type, instead of anatomical areas.

\subsection{Multi-modal registration}
It is a common practice within the neuroimaging community to use the cross-correlation metric to register T1 vs T2 brain MRI images. The argument in favor of using
this metric is that these modalities are related by an ``almost linear'' transfer function. To illustrate the danger of doing this, we used the Brainweb synthetic
template \cite{Cocosco1997}\cite{Kwan1999}. Brainweb provides two perfectly aligned, realistically simulated brain MRI in T1 and T2 modalities. Ideally, a multi-modal
registration method should return the identity transformation to register these perfectly aligned images.
Figure \ref{fig:t1_t2_reg_pannel} depicts the result of registering the images using the SyN algorithm with the different metrics. We can see that using the CC metric,
the cortex was (incorrectly) strongly deformed with a maximum displacement of 11.7mm. and an average of 2.98mm.: the deformation field maximizing the cross correlation between the two multi-modal images does not coincides with the deformation field
correctly aligning the images. Although the deformation field is not exactly zero using the ECC metric (a maximum displacement of 2.6 mm, and an average of 0.15mm.), the deformations
are much smaller. Using MI, the moving image is left almost unchanged with a maximum displacement of 0.4mm and an average of 0.06mm.

Row 3: with the ECC metric deformations are less visible, with an average displacement of 0.15 mm. and a maximum of 2.6 mm. Row 4: the MI metric leaves the image almost unchanged
with an average of 0.06 mm. and a maximum of 0.4 mm.}

\end{figure}



The above experiment is hardly a compelling evidence that the ECC metric performs better than CC for multi-modal registration. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge,
there are no manually annotated multi-modality data publicly available, so we will perform a less
realistic experiment using the Brainweb template. We generated synthetic T2 images for all IBSR T1 images by first registering the Brainweb T1 image (which plays the role of
moving image) towards each IBSR T1 image (which play the role of static image) using ANTS. Then we applied the obtained deformation field to the Brainweb T2 image and computed
the transfer function from T1 to T2 intensities and applied the transfer function to the IBSR T1 obtaining a ``perfectly aligned'' realistic synthetic T2 image for each IBSR volume
(fig. \ref{fig:semi_synthetic}), therefore the annotations remain exactly the same as the T1 counterparts and we are able to compute the overlap scores as before. Note that the number
of registrations we need to perform is now 612 because we can use the T2 modality either as the moving or the static image. Table \ref{tab:multimodal_results_seg} and
figure \ref{fig:multi_seg} show the results analogous to table \ref{tab:monomodal_results_seg} and figure \ref{fig:mono_graph_seg} but this time averaged over 612
multimodal registrations. Note how the performance of the CC metric strongly drops while EM and ECC are less affected by the change of modality. Table
\ref{tab:multimodal_results_segTri_fill} and figure \ref{fig:multi_graph_segTri_fill} show the overlap scores of tissue types, where the same
behavior can be observed.\\
