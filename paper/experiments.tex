\section{Experiments}
Validation is one of the most challenging aspects of developing image registration algorithms for brain MRI. In order to rigorously evaluate the performance of non-linear
image registration algorithms, we would require a ground-truth consisting of true correspondences between voxels of realistic pairs of images. Since such a ground-truth data is
not currently available, researchers resort to surrogates that indirectly measure the quality of their algorithms. One of the most accepted surrogate measures is based
on the overlap of localized anatomical areas of registered images: ideally, corresponding anatomical areas of perfectly registered images should perfectly
overlap. Even a perfect registration algorithm is unlikely to achieve such an ambitious goal, though, since anatomical areas are usually defined manually by an expert, which is
by no means a perfect process and the annotations may vary even between different experts. Despite this limitation, it has been shown that among the alternative surrogate measures
usually employed, overlap scores of localized anatomical areas is the one that better distinguish reasonable from inaccurate registrations \cite{Rohlfing2012} and it has been employed
in the most rigorous evaluations of registration algorithms \cite{Klein2009}\cite{Klein2010}\cite{Rohlfing2012}. We also believe that rigorous reproducibility is of utmost importance. In our
experiments, we employ the publicly available IBSR database consisting of 18 manually annotated T1 brain MRI volumes, and our algorithms are publicly available from the Dipy
non-linear registration module \cite{Garyfallidis2014}.\\

The methods under evaluation in this section are: 1) SyN with the Normalized Cross Correlation metric \cite{Avants2008}, denoted ``SyN-CC'', 2) SyN with the Mutual Information metric \cite{Mattes2003}, denoted ``SyN-MI'', available in the ANTs software package, 3) the SyN-EM algorithm (alg. \ref{alg:SyNEM}) proposed in section \ref{sec:syn_em}, and
4) the SyN-ECC algorithm (alg. \ref{alg:SyNECC}) proposed in section \ref{sec:syn_ecc}.

\subsection{Mono-modal registration}
Although our algorithms were designed for multi-modal image registration, it is important to first verify that the quality of the algorithms is reasonable for mono-modal registration.
Table \ref{tab:monomodal_results_seg} and figure \ref{fig:mono_graph_seg} show the average overlap score for each of 31 manually annotated anatomical regions from the IBSR database.
Note that the Jaccard indices obtained with the Cross Correlation metric (i.e. ANTS) are higher than reported by Rohlfing {\it et al.} \cite{Rohlfing2012}. In his experiments, he used
three resolutions with a maximum of 10, 10 and 5 iterations only. Here, we set a maximum of 100, 100 and 25 iterations, leaving the rest of the parameters
unchanged. We can see that SyN with the EM metric is very competitive, but still not as good as Cross Correlation. This may be explained by the fact that CC uses a relatively large
window centered at each voxel for computing the similarity, while the EM is voxelwise. This behavior can also be observed from the results of SyN with Mutual Information (MI), which is also
voxelwise and very competitve but not as good as CC. By considering neighborhoods of the same size, the performance of the Expected Cross Correlation metric is practically the
same as CC. Table \ref{tab:monomodal_results_segTri_fill} shows the overlap scores over tissue type, instead of anatomical areas.

\subsection{Multi-modal registration}
The cross-correlation metric is occasionally tried for some multi-modal image registration tasks. The reason is that the
metric optimality is reached when the relationship between the two image modalities is locally affine. However, in general, this condition is not met. To illustrate this,
we used the Brainweb synthetic template \cite{Cocosco1997}\cite{Kwan1999}. Brainweb provides two perfectly aligned, realistically simulated brain MRI in T1 and T2 modalities.
Ideally, a multi-modal registration method should return the identity transformation to register these perfectly aligned images.
Figure \ref{fig:t1_t2_reg_pannel} depicts the result of registering the images using the SyN algorithm with four different metrics. We can see that using the CC metric,
the cortex was (incorrectly) strongly deformed: the deformation field maximizing the cross correlation between the two multi-modal images does not coincides with the deformation field correctly aligning the images. This effect is less pronounced using the EM metric. Despite the deformation field is not exactly zero using the ECC metric, the deformations
are much smaller. Using MI, the moving image is left almost unchanged with a maximum displacement of 0.4mm and an average of 0.06mm (table \ref{tab:deformation_magnitude}). The reason that the CC metric does not perform well in this experiment is that the transfer function between the two modalities is not locally affine (fig. \ref{fig:transfers}). Despite the MI metric successfully reaches its maximum very close to the identity transformation, we must consider that it depends on an accurate computation of the joint and marginal intensity distributions of both modalities, which is not known {it a priori} and needs to be iteratively refined as the registration evolves. By providing two perfectly aligned images as input, the intensity distributions can be accurately computed from iteration one, which is an unrealistic scenario. Thus, a more realistic validation protocol is required to quantitatively evaluate the metrics under comparison in the multi-modal case.

Row 3: with the ECC metric deformations are smaller than with the EM metric. Row 4: the MI metric leaves the image almost unchanged (see table \ref{tab:deformation_magnitude} for detailed numerical results). Note that, with exception of the CC metric, the largest deformations occur outside of the region of interest, which is a result of the regularization term.}

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there are no manually annotated multi-modality data publicly available to evaluate the registration performance quantitatively,
so we will perform a less realistic experiment using the Brainweb template. We generated synthetic T2 images for all IBSR T1 images by following the procedure illustrated in fig. (\ref{fig:semi_synthetic_image_creation}). We first register the Brainweb T1 template (which plays the role of moving image) towards each IBSR T1 image (which play the role of static image) using ANTs with the CC metric (a mono-modal registration problem). Then we applied the obtained deformation field to the Brainweb T2 template. The transfer function from the real T1 image to the warped T2 template is computed as the average T2 intensity associated to each T1 intensity. The computed transfer function is then applied to the real IBSR T1 image obtaining a ``perfectly aligned'' realistic synthetic T2 image for each IBSR volume (fig. \ref{fig:semi_synthetic}), therefore the annotations remain exactly the same as the T1 counterparts and we are able to compute the overlap scores as before. Note that the number
of registrations we need to perform is now 612 because we can use the T2 modality either as the moving or the static image. Table \ref{tab:multimodal_results_seg} and
figure \ref{fig:multi_seg} show the results analogous to table \ref{tab:monomodal_results_seg} and figure \ref{fig:mono_graph_seg} but this time averaged over 612
multimodal registrations. Note how the performance of the CC metric strongly drops while EM and ECC are less affected by the change of modality. Table
\ref{tab:multimodal_results_segTri_fill} shows the overlap scores of tissue types, where the same behavior can be observed.\\
