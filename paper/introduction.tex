\section{Introduction}
\textcolor{red}{We need an introduction with the right style for the journal we are submitting.}\\

Our contributions are: 1) we adapted the EM framework for Multi-Modal Non-linear Registration proposed by Arce-Santana {\it et al.}\cite{Arce-santana2014} (originally
developed under the elastic deformation framework) under the Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration framework developed by Avants {\it et al.}\cite{Avants2008}
\cite{Avants2011} and taking advantage of both image modalities, 2)we propose a new metric, called Expected Cross-Correlation, which extends the Cross-Correlation metric for multi-modality images by taking
advantage of the estimated transfer functions provided by the EM framework, and 3)we propose a quantitative validation methodology for multi-modal brain MRI registration methods
based on generating semi-synthetic images using real mono-modal brain images and a synthetic multi-modal template, to the best of our knowledge this is the first
quantitative evaluation for multi-modal registration algorithms using real annotated brain images.
