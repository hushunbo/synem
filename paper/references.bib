abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging is often performed by acquiring a series of diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar images with different direction diffusion gradients. A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas. The resulting DT maps exhibit considerably higher geometric fidelity, as assessed by comparison to an image volume acquired using a conventional 3D MR technique.},

abstract = {This paper describes DARTEL, which is an algorithm for diffeomorphic image registration. It is implemented for both 2D and 3D image registration and has been formulated to include an option for estimating inverse consistent deformations. Nonlinear registration is considered as a local optimisation problem, which is solved using a Levenberg-Marquardt strategy. The necessary matrix solutions are obtained in reasonable time using a multigrid method. A constant Eulerian velocity framework is used, which allows a rapid scaling and squaring method to be used in the computations. DARTEL has been applied to intersubject registration of 471 whole brain images, and the resulting deformations were evaluated in terms of how well they encode the shape information necessary to separate male and female subjects and to predict the ages of the subjects.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

abstract = {We develop a novel Lagrangian reference frame diffeomorphic image and landmark registration method. The algorithm uses the fixed Langrangian reference frame to define the map between coordinate systems, but also generates and stores the inverse map from the Eulerian to the Lagrangian frame. Computing both maps allows facile computation of both Eulerian and Langrangian quantities. We apply this algorithm to estimating a putative evolutionary change of coordinates between a population of chimpanzee and human cortices. Inter-species functional homologues fix the map explicitly, where they are known, while image similarities guide the alignment elsewhere. This map allows detailed study of the volumetric change between chimp and human cortex. Instead of basing the inter-species study on a single species atlas, we diffeomorphically connect the mean shape and intensity templates for each group. The human statistics then map diffeomorphically into the space of the chimpanzee cortex providing a comparison between species. The population statistics show a significant doubling of the relative prefrontal lobe size in humans, as compared to chimpanzees.},

abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

abstract = {A general automatic approach is presented for accommodating local shape variation when mapping a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) template image into alignment with a topologically similar target image. Local shape variability is accommodated by applying a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate system of the template while constraining the transformation to be smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations. Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the constrained optimization problem. Automatic regridding is performed by propagating templates as the nonlinear transformations evaluated on a finite lattice become singular. Application of the method to intersubject registration of neuroanatomical structures illustrates the ability to account for local anatomical variability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for image registration based on jointly estimating the forward and reverse transformations between two images while constraining these transforms to be inverses of one another. This approach produces a consistent set of transformations that have less pairwise registration error, i.e., better correspondence, than traditional methods that estimate the forward and reverse transformations independently. The transformations are estimated iteratively and are restricted to preserve topology by constraining them to obey the laws of continuum mechanics. The transformations are parameterized by a Fourier series to diagonalize the covariance structure imposed by the continuum mechanics constraints and to provide a computationally efficient numerical implementation. Results using a linear elastic material constraint are presented using both magnetic resonance and X-ray computed tomography image data. The results show that the joint estimation of a consistent set of forward and reverse transformations constrained by linear-elasticity give better registration results than using either constraint alone or none at all.},

In this paper we describe inversion techniques and determine their accuracy in the context of 18 inter-subject brain image registrations. Scattered data interpolation (SDI) is used to initialise locally and globally consistent iterative techniques. The inverse-consistency error, E(IC) is computed over the whole image and over 10 specific brain regions. SDI produced good results with mean (max) E(IC) approximately 0.02mm (2.0mm). Both iterative method produced mean errors of approximately 0.005mm but the globally consistent method resulted in a smaller maximum error (1.9mm compared with 1.4mm). The largest errors were in the cerebral cortex with large outlier errors in the ventricles. Simple iterative techniques are, on this evidence, able to produce reasonable estimates of inverse displacement fields provided there is good initialisation.},

abstract = {Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are provided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in five countries and three continents, which is still growing.},

abstract = {Deformable registration of images obtained from different modalities remains a challenging task in medical image analysis. This paper addresses this important problem and proposes a modality independent neighbourhood descriptor (MIND) for both linear and deformable multi-modal registration. Based on the similarity of small image patches within one image, it aims to extract the distinctive structure in a local neighbourhood, which is preserved across modalities. The descriptor is based on the concept of image self-similarity, which has been introduced for non-local means filtering for image denoising. It is able to distinguish between different types of features such as corners, edges and homogeneously textured regions. MIND is robust to the most considerable differences between modalities: non-functional intensity relations, image noise and non-uniform bias fields. The multi-dimensional descriptor can be efficiently computed in a dense fashion across the whole image and provides point-wise local similarity across modalities based on the absolute or squared difference between descriptors, making it applicable for a wide range of transformation models and optimisation algorithms. We use the sum of squared differences of the MIND representations of the images as a similarity metric within a symmetric non-parametric Gauss-Newton registration framework. In principle, MIND would be applicable to the registration of arbitrary modalities. In this work, we apply and validate it for the registration of clinical 3D thoracic CT scans between inhale and exhale as well as the alignment of 3D CT and MRI scans. Experimental results show the advantages of MIND over state-of-the-art techniques such as conditional mutual information and entropy images, with respect to clinically annotated landmark locations.},

Conventionally, medical image registration techniques rely on continuous optimisation, which is prone to local minima. Recent advances in the mathematics and new programming methods enable these disadvantages to be overcome using discrete optimisation. In this paper, we present a new technique deeds, which employs a discrete dense displacement sampling for the deformable registration of high resolution CT volumes. The image grid is represented as a minimum spanning tree. Given these constraints a global optimum of the cost function can be found efficiently using dynamic programming, which enforces the smoothness of the deformations. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of deeds: the registration error for the challenging registration of inhale and exhale pulmonary CT scans is significantly lower than for two state-of-the-art registration techniques, especially in the presence of large deformations and sliding motion at lung surfaces.},

abstract = {Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.},

abstract = {Establishing correspondences across brains for the purposes of comparison and group analysis is almost universally done by registering images to one another either directly or via a template. However, there are many registration algorithms to choose from. A recent evaluation of fully automated nonlinear deformation methods applied to brain image registration was restricted to volume-based methods. The present study is the first that directly compares some of the most accurate of these volume registration methods with surface registration methods, as well as the first study to compare registrations of whole-head and brain-only (de-skulled) images. We used permutation tests to compare the overlap or Hausdorff distance performance for more than 16,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brain images. We compared every combination of volume-based and surface-based labels, registration, and evaluation. Our primary findings are the following: 1. de-skulling aids volume registration methods; 2. custom-made optimal average templates improve registration over direct pairwise registration; and 3. resampling volume labels on surfaces or converting surface labels to volumes introduces distortions that preclude a fair comparison between the highest ranking volume and surface registration methods using present resampling methods. From the results of this study, we recommend constructing a custom template from a limited sample drawn from the same or a similar representative population, using the same algorithm used for registering brains to the template.},

@article{Li2012,
abstract = {This paper presents registration via embedded maps (REM), a deformable registration algorithm for images with varying topology. The algorithm represents 3-D images as 4-D manifolds in a Riemannian space (referred to as embedded maps). Registration is performed as a surface evolution matching one embedded map to another using a diffusion process. The approach differs from those existing in that it takes an a priori estimation of image regions where topological changes are present, for example lesions, and generates a dense vector field representing both the shape and intensity changes necessary to match the images. The algorithm outputs both a diffeomorphic deformation field and an intensity displacement which corrects the intensity difference caused by topological changes. Multiple sets of experiments are conducted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with lesions from OASIS and ADNI datasets. These images are registered to either a brain template or images of healthy individuals. An exemplar case registering a template to an MRI with tumor is also given. The resulting deformation fields were compared with those obtained using diffeomorphic demons, where topological changes are not modeled. These sets of experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed REM method for registration of brain MRI with severe topological differences.},

abstract = {We have implemented and validated an algorithm for three-dimensional positron emission tomography transmission-to-computed tomography registration in the chest, using mutual information as a similarity criterion. Inherent differences in the two imaging protocols produce significant nonrigid motion between the two acquisitions. A rigid body deformation combined with localized cubic B-splines is used to capture this motion. The deformation is defined on a regular grid and is parameterized by potentially several thousand coefficients. Together with a spline-based continuous representation of images and Parzen histogram estimates, our deformation model allows closed-form expressions for the criterion and its gradient. A limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is used in a hierarchical multiresolution framework to automatically align the images. To characterize the performance of the method, 27 scans from patients involved in routine lung cancer staging were used in a validation study. The registrations were assessed visually by two expert observers in specific anatomic locations using a split window validation technique. The visually reported errors are in the 0- to 6-mm range and the average computation time is 100 min on a moderate-performance workstation.},

@article{Prastawa2009,
abstract = {Obtaining validation data and comparison metrics for segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) are difficult tasks due to the lack of reliable ground truth. This problem is even more evident for images presenting pathology, which can both alter tissue appearance through infiltration and cause geometric distortions. Systems for generating synthetic images with user-defined degradation by noise and intensity inhomogeneity offer the possibility for testing and comparison of segmentation methods. Such systems do not yet offer simulation of sufficiently realistic looking pathology. This paper presents a system that combines physical and statistical modeling to generate synthetic multi-modal 3D brain MRI with tumor and edema, along with the underlying anatomical ground truth, Main emphasis is placed on simulation of the major effects known for tumor MRI, such as contrast enhancement, local distortion of healthy tissue, infiltrating edema adjacent to tumors, destruction and deformation of fiber tracts, and multi-modal MRI contrast of healthy tissue and pathology. The new method synthesizes pathology in multi-modal MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by simulating mass effect, warping and destruction of white matter fibers, and infiltration of brain tissues by tumor cells. We generate synthetic contrast enhanced MR images by simulating the accumulation of contrast agent within the brain. The appearance of the the brain tissue and tumor in MRI is simulated by synthesizing texture images from real MR images. The proposed method is able to generate synthetic ground truth and synthesized MR images with tumor and edema that exhibit comparable segmentation challenges to real tumor MRI. Such image data sets will find use in segmentation reliability studies, comparison and validation of different segmentation methods, training and teaching, or even in evaluating standards for tumor size like the RECIST criteria (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors).},

abstract = {The accuracy of nonrigid image registrations is commonly approximated using surrogate measures such as tissue label overlap scores, image similarity, image difference, or transformation inverse consistency error. This paper provides experimental evidence that these measures, even when used in combination, cannot distinguish accurate from inaccurate registrations. To this end, we introduce a "registration" algorithm that generates highly inaccurate image transformations, yet performs extremely well in terms of the surrogate measures. Of the tested criteria, only overlap scores of localized anatomical regions reliably distinguish reasonable from inaccurate registrations, whereas image similarity and tissue overlap do not. We conclude that tissue overlap and image similarity, whether used alone or together, do not provide valid evidence for accurate registrations and should thus not be reported or accepted as such.},

We show that this new optimizer is well adapted to a multiresolution approach because it typically converges in fewer criterion evaluations than other optimizers. We have built a multiresolution image pyramid, along with an interpolation process, an optimizer, and the criterion itself, around the unifying concept of spline-processing. This ensures coherence in the way we model data and yields good performance. We have tested our approach in a variety of experimental conditions and report excellent results. We claim an accuracy of about a hundredth of a pixel under ideal conditions. We are also robust since the accuracy is still about a tenth of a pixel under very noisy conditions. In addition, a blind evaluation of our results compares very favorably to the work of several other researchers.},

abstract = {Modern morphometric studies use non-linear image registration to compare anatomies and perform group analysis. Recently, log-Euclidean approaches have contributed to promote the use of such computational anatomy tools by permitting simple computations of statistics on a rather large class of invertible spatial transformations. In this work, we propose a non-linear registration algorithm perfectly fit for log-Euclidean statistics on diffeomorphisms. Our algorithm works completely in the log-domain, i.e. it uses a stationary velocity field. This implies that we guarantee the invertibility of the deformation and have access to the true inverse transformation. This also means that our output can be directly used for log-Euclidean statistics without relying on the heavy computation of the log of the spatial transformation. As it is often desirable, our algorithm is symmetric with respect to the order of the input images. Furthermore, we use an alternate optimization approach related to Thirion's demons algorithm to provide a fast non-linear registration algorithm. First results show that our algorithm outperforms both the demons algorithm and the recently proposed diffeomorphic demons algorithm in terms of accuracy of the transformation while remaining computationally efficient.},

abstract = {A new approach to the problem of multimodality medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.},

@article{Hahn2010,
abstract = {Over the past ten years similarity measures based on intensity distributions have become state-of-the-art in automatic multimodal image registration. An implementation for clinical usage has to support a plurality of images. However, a generally applicable parameter configuration for the number and sizes of histogram bins, optimal Parzen-window kernel widths or background thresholds cannot be found. This explains why various research groups present partly contradictory empirical proposals for these parameters. This paper proposes a set of data-driven estimation schemes for a parameter-free implementation that eliminates major caveats of heuristic trial and error. We present the following novel approaches: a new coincidence weighting scheme to reduce the influence of background noise on the similarity measure in combination with Max-Lloyd requantization, and a tradeoff for the automatic estimation of the number of histogram bins. These methods have been integrated into a state-of-the-art rigid registration that is based on normalized mutual information and applied to CT-MR, PET-MR, and MR-MR image pairs of the RIRE 2.0 database. We compare combinations of the proposed techniques to a standard implementation using default parameters, which can be found in the literature, and to a manual registration by a medical expert. Additionally, we analyze the effects of various histogram sizes, sampling rates, and error thresholds for the number of histogram bins. The comparison of the parameter selection techniques yields 25 approaches in total, with 114 registrations each. The number of bins has no significant influence on the proposed implementation that performs better than both the manual and the standard method in terms of acceptance rates and target registration error (TRE). The overall mean TRE is 2.34 mm compared to 2.54 mm for the manual registration and 6.48 mm for a standard implementation. Our results show a significant TRE reduction for distortion-corrected magnetic resonance images.},

@article{Wells1996,
abstract = {A new information-theoretic approach is presented for finding the registration of volumetric medical images of differing modalities. Registration is achieved by adjustment of the relative position and orientation until the mutual information between the images is maximized. In our derivation of the registration procedure, few assumptions are made about the nature of the imaging process. As a result the algorithms are quite general and can foreseeably be used with a wide variety of imaging devices. This approach works directly with image data; no pre-processing or segmentation is required. This technique is, however, more flexible and robust than other intensity-based techniques like correlation. Additionally, it has an efficient implementation that is based on stochastic approximation. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the approach registering magnetic resonance (MR) images with computed tomography (CT) images, and with positron-emission tomography (PET) images. Surgical applications of the registration method are described.},

@article{Smith2012,
abstract = {Diffusion MRI streamlines tractography suffers from a number of inherent limitations, one of which is the accurate determination of when streamlines should be terminated. Use of an accurate streamlines propagation mask from segmentation of an anatomical image confines the streamlines to the volume of the brain white matter, but does not take full advantage of all of the information available from such an image. We present a modular addition to streamlines tractography, which makes more effective use of the information available from anatomical image segmentation, and the known properties of the neuronal axons being reconstructed, to apply biologically realistic priors to the streamlines generated; we refer to this as "Anatomically-Constrained Tractography". Results indicate that some of the known false positives associated with tractography algorithms are prevented, such that the biological accuracy of the reconstructions should be improved, provided that state-of-the-art streamlines tractography methods are used.},
