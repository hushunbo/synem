\section{Conclusion}
We presented two algorithms for Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration for multi-modality images. The first algorithm was recently proposed by Arce-Santana {\it et al.}
\cite{Arce-santana2014} under the (asymmetric) elastic registration framework and we extended it in this work to take advantage of both modalities under the
Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration framework developed by Avants {\it et al.}. The second algorithm is an extension of the Cross-Correlation metric for multi-modality
images. We evaluated our algorithms using the publicly available IBSR database following the methodology of Klein {\it et al.} \cite{Klein2009}\cite{Klein2010} and
Rohlfing \cite{Rohlfing2012} to show that both algorithms are competitive for mono-modal image registration, even though they were designed for multi-modal registration.
To evaluate the performance of our algorithms in a realistic, controlled, multi-modal registration experiment we used the Brainweb\cite{Cocosco1997}\cite{Kwan1999} template
to generate synthetic T2 images for each of the IBSR T1 volumes. Experiments show that the CC metric is dramatically affected by the change of modality while our algorithms'
performance remains comparable to the mono-modal case.\\

To the best of our knowledge, prior to this work, the only publicly available algorithm for Multi-Modal Symmetric Diffeomorphic Registration was driven by the Mutual Information
metric and was provided in the ANTS software,\textcolor{red}{and we show that our algorithms compare favourably against that reference implementation (note: the results of
MI are extremely bad, so bad that people won't believe it... I need to investigate if I am doing something wrong.)}. We made our algorithms publicly available in Dipy
[citation needed].
