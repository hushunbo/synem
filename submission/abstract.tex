    We present a new algorithm for multi-modal symmetric diffeomorphic image registration. The transfer functions between the two modalities are modeled as a set of hidden variables. We apply the greedy symmetric image normalization method (SyN) to efficiently maximize the image similarity metric in the space of diffeomorphic transformations. We validate our algorithm using the publicly available Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) database and the Brainweb synthetic template, obtaining very competitive results in both mono- and multi-modal image registration. As a natural extension, we generalize the widely used normalized cross correlation metric, for multi-modal images, and show that the resulting metric, which we call expected cross correlation, performs better than the original cross correlation in the multi-modal case, without reducing performance in the mono-modal case.
