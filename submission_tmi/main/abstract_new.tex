    We present a new similarity measure for multi-modal brain MRI registration. The relationship between voxel intensities in both modalities is modeled as a global non-linear transfer function that makes their local \textcolor{red}{intensity correspondence} as linear as possible. The proposed similarity measure results from a maximum-likelihood estimation of our model's parameters. We show that our functional is closely related to the local Cross Correlation metric and the optimal transfer function used in the Correlation Ratio. We implemented our similarity measure to drive the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) algorithm and compared its performance to traditional similarity metrics using real, publicly available, brain MR images. Quantitative results show that our proposal performs better than cross correlation and mutual information in the multi-modal case without reducing performance in the mono-modal case.
